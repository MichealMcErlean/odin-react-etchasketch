# Etch-a-Sketch
## An Odin Project exercise

Redoing this one in React for the practice. I don't foresee needing much more from React than keeping track of some state; I'm more interested in how I have to change things to account for needing to do re-renders frequently (unlike the original project, where a cell naturally held its state until a full refresh was done.

Also going to try adding some stuff - giving a choice between picking a colour or going rainbow lilke the original challenge option, make the opacity challenge an optional mode. And I'm going to try making drawing on the board require holding the mouse button down while dragging - see how much of a difference that makes to implementation.
